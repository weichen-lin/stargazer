## Introduction

Welcome to our GitHub Stars Integration & Natural Language Search! Our goal is to seamlessly integrate GitHub Stars project information and offer an intuitive natural language search experience. This system employs cutting-edge technologies for crawling, processing, and presenting GitHub project data effectively.

## Data Handling

### Regular GitHub Stars Crawling

We regularly crawl user GitHub Stars projects to keep our system up-to-date with the latest information.

### Readme Data Extraction

Valuable information is extracted from Readme files, serving as a rich source of project details and documentation.

## Processing

### GPT Model for Readme Summaries

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models generate concise Readme file summaries, providing users with quick project overviews.

### Embedding Algorithm for Vectors

To enhance search capabilities, an embedding algorithm converts summaries into vectors, stored in a database for efficient retrieval.

## User Interaction

### Natural Language Queries

Users interact with our system using natural language queries for an intuitive and user-friendly search experience.

### Vector-based Search

Our system employs vector-based search to match user intentions with the most relevant projects, allowing a nuanced understanding of project content.
